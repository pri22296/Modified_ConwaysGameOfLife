# Cellular Automata

Here is presented an implementation of a general N-state cellular automata in Python.
The three integral components are:

1. Grid - The state of each cell in the grid is dependent on it's neighbour. Provided is a sample implementation of the
          Conway's game of life, generalized to multiple states.

2. Agent - An agent which moves in the grid and changes it's state based on it's own state. Provided is a sample implementation of
           agent's like the langdon's ant and other turmites.

3. Automata - Responsible for integrating the Grid and the agent and making them interact. Also responsible for the rendering.

## Why I made this?

It was fun and wanted to challenge myself.
